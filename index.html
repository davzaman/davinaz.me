						<h1 class="red">Grace Hopper Celebration Scholarship (2017) </h1>
						<p>The Computer Science department at UCSB funded some of its students for the first time to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.</p>
						<p>Honestly a wonderful event, I am looking forward to being able to attend again in the future.</p>

						<h1 class="red">KPCB Fellow and Decision Committee (2017) </h1>
						<p>I had the honor of being a part of the Kleiner Perkins Fellows program while interning at Pinterest.</p>
						<p>After surviving eliminations out of thousands of applicants, I was able to join 80 other Fellows in many networking events and workshops with technical leaders in Silicon Valley.</p>
						<p>Additionally, I served on the Decision Committee to help pick up potential Fellows for 2018.</p>
						<p>Also, Gini Kim is my idol.</p>

						<h1 class="red">Phi Sigma Rho Chapter Founder</h1>
						<p><a href="http://www.phisigmarho.org/">Phi Sigma Rho</a> is a nationally recognized sorority focused on women in STEM.</p>
						<p>After responding to an an email blast for interest, I helped establish the Alphi Xi chapter of Phi Sigma Rho at UCSB and became part of the founding class in Spring of 2016.</p>
						<p>It wasn't until Fall of 2017 that we became an official chapter, where we all wanted to cry of happiness because our hard work had paid off.</p>
						<p>Through the process of being in charge of designs, involved in planning events, writing bylaws, recruiting, and mentorship, I had an incredible and rewarding experience with other women engineers that I will always remember.</p>

						<h1 class="red">SB Hacks Organizer</h1>
						<p>Starting from my freshman year to my senior year, I watched as SB Hacks grew into something incredible.</p>
						<p>I was involved with logistics (venue, food, etc), design, and getting sponsors throughout my time with the team.</p>

						<h1 class="red">Thomas Edison Award (2013) </h1>
						<p>I participated and won first place in my very first hackathon.</p>
						<p>Out of 15 teams, and hours I don't want to think about, my team won for most creative and useful project for the company.</p>
						
						<h1 class="red">Programming Club President and Founder (High School)</h1>
						<p>After taking Intro to CS at UCLA after my freshman year, I decided that I alone should not have to suffer the wrath of C++.</p>
						<p>I saw there was no programming clubs at my school, so I made one.</p>
						<p>In some odd foreshadowing of continuing to graduate school, I created lessons plans as well as coding exercises to teach C++ to club members.</p>
