						<b>Abstract</b>
						<br>
						Many real-world datasets suffer from missing data, which can introduce uncertainty into ensuing
						analyses. To address missing data, researchers have been developing, analyzing, and comparing
						statistical and machine learning techniques for missing data estimation or imputation. In this
						context, we built an original framework, Autopopulus, and performed novel analyses that explored
						predictive pipelines using flexible autoencoder-led imputation. Our work examines
						autoencoder-led
						imputation with a deeper regard for the taxonomy of missingness scenarios and mixed feature data
						of
						large real-world clinical datasets. In this dissertation we quantify, in a direct manner, the
						extent
						to which different methods of imputation affect downstream tasks, and therefore provide
						rationale
						for how to choose a solution for a particular dataset and task. We illuminate important
						decision-making points when assembling a data processing pipeline that handles missing data,
						while
						our framework itself allows researchers to apply and compare solutions directly in a unified way
						for
						any large dataset. We find that there are different imputation traits under a more granular
						classification of missingness scenarios, and that trends between imputation performance
						superiority
						and predictive performance superiority do not align. Based on our exploration, we believe that
						the
						characterization of missingness in the literature must be expanded and that imputing accurately
						is
						not always necessary for predicting accurately. We are just beginning to have a clearer view of
						just
						how wide the gap is in our understanding and classification of missingness and have hope that
						this
						new information will lead to progress in comprehending both the unknown and the unknowable
